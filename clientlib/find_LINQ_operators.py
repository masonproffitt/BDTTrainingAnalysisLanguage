    We are called on expressions that are parsed in-line, and when we see calls to things like Select, we replace them
    with the AST entries appropriate.

    ObjectStream has methods called Select and SelectMany. When they are called, they build up the AST tree. But they do that
    by creating Select and SelectMany, etc., ast nodes. When we parse a lambda passed as text, that does not happen. This
    NodeTransformer does that replacement in-place.
