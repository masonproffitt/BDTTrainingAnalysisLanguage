# Contains AST elements for the query part of an expression.
# This is an extension of the python AST, and is written in that same style.

# AST's are designed to have only data, no code. In that sense, they could
# be transmitted over the wire and received at the other end.
#
# Of course, this being python, it is possible to add new things to the class
# member variables.
#TODO: Remove all Module references to lambdas that are stored in the AST.
